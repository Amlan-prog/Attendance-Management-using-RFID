**#Description**
The Arduino-based RFID Attendance System is a project designed to monitor individuals' attendance using RFID cards. It employs an RFID reader to scan the IDs of RFID cards, presenting pertinent information on an LCD screen. The provided code encompasses the essential features of the system, such as card scanning, attendance tracking, and storage of relevant data.

**#Requirements**
To run this code and set up the RFID Attendance System, you will need the following components:
1. Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
2. RFID reader module and compatible RFID cards
3. LCD display (compatible with the LiquidCrystal library)
4. Buzzer and LED (optional for providing feedback)


**#Setup**
•	Connect the RFID reader to the Arduino board using the appropriate pins (refer to the code for pin assignments).
•	Connect the LCD display to the Arduino board using the necessary connections (refer to the code for pin assignments).
•	If using a buzzer and LED for feedback, connect them to the appropriate pins as specified in the code.
•	Install the necessary libraries for the RFID reader and LCD display. You can find the required libraries and installation instructions on the respective library repositories.
•	Upload the provided code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or any compatible software.

**#Features**
•	Supports up to 10 different RFID cards and associated names.
•	Tracks the entry and exit times of users.
•	Calculates the total hours and minutes of presence for each user.
•	Stores presence data in non-volatile EEPROM memory.
•	Provides visual feedback through an LCD display, buzzer, and LED
